She was on welfare and would've been collecting all the various monies associated with welfare and having young children. Possibly the worst thing about this woman having babies for income was how these children were cared for, or lack of care. I was invited to the place where they lived, an old trailer with one rocking chair, and a wobbly table. The woman opened up the pantry and there were DOZENS of cans of tuna!! She also seemed proud of the fact that she had rented her house and was living in this firetrap for free. She told me that she had just spent $100 on socks for the kids! This was 30 years ago so that was an extraordinary amount of money to spend for that.
